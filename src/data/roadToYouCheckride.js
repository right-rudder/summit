  introduction:
    "We receive a lot of questions about pilot exams. This document is our attempt to clarify what will happen here at Summit before your checkride, how it is scheduled, what to expect, and the more frequent reasons why an applicant may not be successful.",

      title: 'The "Checkride" and your Examiner',
      content: [
        'The FAA calls your exam for a certificate or additional rating a "Practical Test". Most pilots use the term "checkride". The person administering your exam will be a private citizen appointed by the FAA as a Designated Pilot Examiner (aka DPE). These individuals can charge a reasonable fee for their services. "Reasonable" around the Midwest usually means between $700-$1200, depending on the test and examiner. Initial Flight Instructor Practical Tests are the most expensive due to the long nature of those exams. Additional fees may apply if a recheck is needed or a student voluntarily discontinues an exam.',
        "A DPE is trained to test you according to the applicable testing document provided by the FAA for the rating or certificate sought. This document is called the Airmen Certification Standards (ACS) or the Practical Test Standards (PTS), depending on the test given. The good news is that everything on the test is in the public domain in these freely available documents. Most of the source material is also available in FAA documents such as the FAR/AIM, Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, and the Airplane Flying Handbook. Your CFI will review the ACS/PTS document with you before your test to be sure you are familiar with it.",
        "For the oral, the FAA is looking for an application level of knowledge. This means you take what you know and understand and make use of that insight to apply it to the task or situation at hand. If you can read a weather report (Rote), that's a start. If you can understand what it means, good! But the expectation that the FAA has is that you will be able to apply your knowledge to your flight and go/no-go decision.",
        'During the flight, the failure line is "consistently exceeds the standards", the creation of a safety issue or lack of action to eliminate a safety issue. It\'s not uncommon for a DPE to give an applicant a "three chances" approach. For example, if you bust an altitude once and bust an airspeed once but everything else went great, you will pass. Perfection is not the expectation. While there are some tasks that have very black and white completion standards, DPEs want you to pass and if they are seeing consistent adherence to the standards, then you will do great. A DPE does not grade technique, they grade outcomes as they relate to a test standard.',

      title: "Knowledge Test",
      content:
        'We typically ask our students to take their knowledge before solo or before the mid-point in the training for Practical Tests beyond private pilot. We do this to make sure the learning is well distributed throughout your course and to give us time to address any weaknesses that show up in your written test. An examiner is required to include in their test plan any topics you miss on your written. This is one of the reasons we want students to do well on the knowledge test. Getting a barely passing score makes your oral exam more complicated than it needs to be and opens you up to first impressions that may be less favorable if you "barely passed" your written.',
    },
    {
      title: "When can I take the checkride?",
      content: [
        "To be qualified to take your test, your CFI will review the requirements in part 61 of the FAA regulations for the certificate or rating you are applying for. There are requirements that must be completed (for example completing X amount of solo time, night flight time, cross country experiences, etc.) as well as standards that you need to meet in your knowledge, skills, and risk management. Your CFI cannot legally sign you off until you meet all requirements.",
        "At Summit Flight, once your syllabus is completed successfully, you will be paired with senior instructor to compete a mock oral exam and a mock flight test. You must pass both to sit for your checkride. If we are working to schedule you into a time slot we have already booked with an examiner, you must schedule and pass these mocks at least two weeks prior to your checkride so we have time to address any lingering deficiencies. Otherwise, we typically will schedule a checkride after you pass the mocks.",
        "When you are ready for your checkride, your instructor will help you schedule it. We have DPEs that we get regular dates for and others that we call and schedule when we have a student just about ready. Most students can get a checkride in less than month from the time we sign you off. Some rides, such as the multi-engine and initial Flight Instructor Practical Test, can take longer to get scheduled due to the limited number of DPEs that are qualified to administer them. Once your test is scheduled, your CFI will continue to work with you on ground and flight lessons to ensure you stay sharp.",
        "As mentioned, your oral exam is going to be based on the testing document from the FAA. The FAA strongly encourages DPEs to administer a scenario-based exam where it makes sense to do so. What this likely means is that your knowledge will be applied to one or more hypothetical situations, and you will be asked to explain how you are going to proceed or what you are going to do, and why.",
        "One recommendation we give students for their checkride is to take the ACS/PTS and use it to create blueprint to your checkride. First, go through each task and sub-item/code and attempt to document where the source of this topic come from. For example, if you are looking at the line item on the Private ACS about BasicMed, the ACS code is PA.I.A.K5 and the regulations are found in part 68 of the FAR. This line item already tells you it is in part 68, so no extra note pointing to the reg is needed. Then on the page, you might make a few key notes to jog your memory about BasicMed that should expect to be able to explain…the privileges and limitations of BasicMed, how to obtain it and how to retain it. If the DPE wants more than you have in your head or notes, you know exactly where to dig in the FARs to answer his or her question.",

Be sure to pre-mark all inspection items and compliance items so you can easily show them to the examiner. Your scenario will likely also give you something "broke" on the airplane and that will spur a conversation that walks through the various airworthiness regulations and different types of equipment lists. The DPE will want to hear you talk through the regulations (e.g. 91.205) and various types of equipment lists, be able to explain what those lists are and if/how they are relevant to your aircraft.',

Another example: It's good that you can explain what a cold front vs. warm front is and how to ID them on a weather product, but can you explain how they can impact a flight? Often your cross-country assignment will be the basis of your weather discussion and applicants at times struggle to get past telling the examiner what is seen or forecast and communicating the impact to the flight. You likely will be asked to make hypothetical go-no go decisions for a scenario given to you by the examiner. Do you have personal minimums documented to clearly show the examiner you are not just making a subjective decision? Often a DPE will press you on your decision and many applicants think that means the DPE is trying to get them to change their go or no-go decision.

Often an EFB will have a profile for your airplane already built but it's common for students to not know where the data came from and be able to substantiate it to the DPE when asked.

A best practice we recommend is printing off the most common charts and using a ruler and pencil to mark them up with the output expected for the performance parameters you are facing for your checkride (expected temps, weight and balance, runway, winds, etc.).

For example, there was a video circulating on the internet of a pilot who lost his electrical system. He panicked and decided he had to land immediately. Unfortunately, he was so bent on landing that he crashed into the rear of another plane that had just landed a few moments sooner than he did.

Study the manuals for your avionics and/or use the simulator apps for those products to be familiar enough with them that you can navigate the user interface well. Applicants have failed a private pilot checkride for not knowing how to change the Garmin 650xi and G5 from GPS mode to ground based nav mode, tuning to a VOR, and navigating to it.

This will typically result in a float past their intended point of landing and sometimes cause the applicant to force the plane onto the runway before it is ready to land. Another common observation involves braking. I understand the desire to extend the life of the brakes, but applicants often do not brake at all and just announce "simulate maximum braking." I am concerned this creates a negative transfer of learning and does not align with the manufacturer\'s recommended procedure for airplane braking. During a test, we often pass multiple taxiways suitable for exiting the runway because the applicant is not even applying normal braking. If brakes or tires are a concern, I request that the applicant at least uses normal braking after touchdown.',

Applicants have enough time to set up for this maneuver and typically don't set up properly prior to entering their first turn. Their altitude is not stable, the power is not set to a desired level, and the trim is not adjusted. During the maneuver it appears that they struggle to maintain altitude when this could have been prevented with taking a little time to properly configure their aircraft prior to the maneuver. Additionally, most aircraft have some sort of wind direction and velocity indicator on one or multiple screens in the cockpit. If this information is present in the cockpit, it greatly benefits the applicant by taking out the guess work of where to bank more and where to bank less throughout the turn. If the information is not present in the cockpit, have the applicant look at winds aloft prior to departure to get a general idea of what the winds will be doing during their flight.",

It is common for applicants to make their entry turn late which starts the maneuver with their pylon behind their reference line of sight often resulting in the applicant drastically pitching up to start the maneuver. Conversely as we come around the pylon the opposite is then needed, and several hundred feet is often lost descending to "catch" the pylon.',

Top of climb, VORs, etc. are not visual waypoints (at least not good ones for the applicant because they need to be visually identified). This task requires the ability to look outside the aircraft and identify the waypoints they've chosen. It also requires they fly the headings they've computed and arrive at their waypoints relatively on time. There is no use of GPS during this task, so have them plan accordingly. They should use their heading indicator, a clock (please please please have them start a timer), and visual references on the ground to navigate to a few points and then we are good to go.",

Before they start the descent, I will let them know that once they reach 3500 the airplane is back to normal again and they can level off and roll wings level on whatever heading they end up on.

Applicants often say they are establishing best glide airspeed, but will get distracted by something else and not pay much attention to their airspeed throughout the descent. Often trim is not used to maintain the best glide airspeed, so unless constant instrument scanning is used the applicant's airspeed will often fluctuate quite a bit. Applicants will typically pick an acceptable landing area but will not consider wind direction and often set up to land with a tailwind. Again, most aircraft I test in have wind direction and velocity indicators which can be a great advantage if the applicant uses it.
