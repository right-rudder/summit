    title: "Why packages?",
    content: `We offer our best pricing with these packages because it allows us to
manage our aircraft and instructor workloads more predictably and efficiently. They
also offer you the best structure for finishing what you started. Additionally, many
financing options require packaging to structure a loan for students needing that
option.`,
  },
  {
    title: "How often will I fly with these packages?",
    content: `Our seven-month program has you scheduled for 2-3 lessons per
week (15-16 aircraft or simulator hours per month). Our ten monthly program is
designed for 2 lessons per week over nine months (9-11 aircraft or simulator hours
per month).`,
  },
  {
    title: "What happens if I don't use all my flight hours?",
    content: `We will gladly roll those hours into another package or you may use
them for rental purposes within 90 days of your checkride.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What happens if I exceed my allocated flight hours?",
    content: `We strive for this not to happen by providing average flight hours that
are needed for the program length you select. However, in the event this happens,
we will provide you additional aircraft and/or instructor hours at an agreed-upon
discounted rate.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What happens if I need to quit or defer my training?",
    content: `Life happens, we get it. If you need to defer your training you may
pause payments and elect a future restart date. If you have paid off your program,
but have not completed it, your program remains valid for one year after the initial
program end date. Upon restart, you may receive a new instructor and experience
the need to fly additional hours to complete your certificate, but we will provide all
hours originally paid for by your package.\n\nIf you need to withdraw from your
program, you will lose access to the preferred package pricing. We will bill you
current retail pricing, plus a 5% administrative fee for all instructor services and
flight time flown. Insurance, ground school, and Foreflight fees are, unfortunately,
non-refundable. Any remaining money on account will be refunded within 7 days of
written notice of withdrawal. If your account is in deficit, we will need the balance
paid off at the time of cancellation.`,
