    paragraph1: `The checkride consists of two main parts: an oral exam and a flight test. The oral exam tests your knowledge of aerodynamics, regulations, aircraft systems, navigation, weather, and decision-making. The flight test evaluates your practical flying skills, including preflight preparation, maneuvers, emergency procedures, cross-country navigation, and communications.`,
    paragraph2: `Successfully completing your checkride means you have demonstrated that you meet FAA standards to operate an aircraft as a private pilot. It's not just a test; it is a confirmation of your skills and knowledge gained throughout your training.`,
