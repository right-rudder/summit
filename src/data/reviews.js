I went to many additional schools before finishing here. Red Arrow is the perfect explanation on how a school can become a second home. Love it. Don’t look elsewhere.",

I got my PPL (Private Pilot License) at this flight school and I couldn't have asked for a better introduction into the world of aviation.",
