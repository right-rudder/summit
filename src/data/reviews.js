    text: "Jami works the desk and she’s the nicest person I’ve ever met - super helpful.  My instructor, Hillary, has been nothing short of amazing to work with.  She has the perfect balance of patience and assertiveness to be a CFI.  They take great care of their planes here.  Come in and take a discovery flight - you won’t regret it.",

    text: "Great flight school! This is what the Kansas City area needed. Aircraft are in great shape, flight instructors are professional and getting setup there is super easy. After selling my last aircraft I have had no problems renting their Piper Archer to keep current. Can't wait till the Twin Comanche comes online! If you have always wanted to learn to fly, this is the first place you should be calling.",

    text: "The best flight school around! Obtained my Private Pilots License in November and passed first try thanks to the amazing team at SFA. I have flown all of the planes other than their newest warrior and will have to say N6894W (Miss Whiskey) was an overall favorite. They planes are all hangared making it easy to fly in the winter and the instructors are the best around making sure they are focused on getting you check ride ready. Thanks for all the help Summit!",

The culture at SFA is comfortable, not high intensity, which leads to better safety due to less stress and pressure. The planes are well maintained. Instructors are high quality and they like working there.I definitely recommend them for flight training in the KC area.",

    text: "The quality and experience of their CFIs and the team Jeremy has put together is phenomenal.  At any time, you are welcome to talk to any available CFI to have access to any knowledge that is on hand. The multiple levels of experience at a student's disposal are hands down the best you can ask for!! SFA instructors will go out of their way to communicate and accommodate your schedule and speed of learning. In addition, the location of the school in Lee’s Summit provides a great opportunity to learn how to fly in numerous types of airspace.",
