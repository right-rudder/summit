    title: 'The "Checkride" and your Examiner',
    descriptions: [
      'The FAA calls your exam for a certificate or additional rating a "Practical Test". Most pilots use the term "checkride". The person administering your exam will be a private citizen appointed by the FAA as a Designated Pilot Examiner (aka DPE). These individuals can charge a reasonable fee for their services. "Reasonable" around the Midwest usually means between $700-$1200, depending on the test and examiner. Initial Flight Instructor Practical Tests are the most expensive due to the long nature of those exams. Additional fees may apply if a recheck is needed or a student voluntarily discontinues an exam.',
      "A DPE is trained to test you according to the applicable testing document provided by the FAA for the rating or certificate sought. This document is called the Airmen Certification Standards (ACS) or the Practical Test Standards (PTS), depending on the test given. The good news is that everything on the test is in the public domain in these freely available documents. Most of the source material is also available in FAA documents such as the FAR/AIM, Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, and the Airplane Flying Handbook. Your CFI will review the ACS/PTS document with you before your test to be sure you are familiar with it.",
      "For the oral, the FAA is looking for an application level of knowledge. This means you take what you know and understand and make use of that insight to apply it to the task or situation at hand. If you can read a weather report (Rote), that's a start. If you can understand what it means, good! But the expectation that the FAA has is that you will be able to apply your knowledge to your flight and go/no-go decision.",
      'During the flight, the failure line is "consistently exceeds the standards", the creation of a safety issue or lack of action to eliminate a safety issue. It\'s not uncommon for a DPE to give an applicant a "three chances" approach. For example, if you bust an altitude once and bust an airspeed once but everything else went great, you will pass. Perfection is not the expectation. While there are some tasks that have very black and white completion standards, DPEs want you to pass and if they are seeing consistent adherence to the standards, then you will do great. A DPE does not grade technique, they grade outcomes as they relate to a test standard.',

      "We typically ask our students to take their knowledge before solo or before the mid-point in the training for Practical Tests beyond private pilot. We do this to make sure the learning is well distributed throughout your course and to give us time to address any weaknesses that show up in your written test.",
      ` An examiner is required to include in their test plan any topics you miss on your written. This is one of the reasons we want students to do well on the knowledge test. Getting a barely passing score makes your oral exam more complicated than it needs to be and opens you up to first impressions that may be less favorable if you "barely passed" your written.`,

    title: "When can I take the checkride?",
    descriptions: [
      "To be qualified to take your test, your CFI will review the requirements in part 61 of the FAA regulations for the certificate or rating you are applying for. There are requirements that must be completed (for example completing X amount of solo time, night flight time, cross country experiences, etc.) as well as standards that you need to meet in your knowledge, skills, and risk management. Your CFI cannot legally sign you off until you meet all requirements.",
      "At Summit Flight, once your syllabus is completed successfully, you will be paired with senior instructor to compete a mock oral exam and a mock flight test. You must pass both to sit for your checkride. If we are working to schedule you into a time slot we have already booked with an examiner, you must schedule and pass these mocks at least two weeks prior to your checkride so we have time to address any lingering deficiencies. Otherwise, we typically will schedule a checkride after you pass the mocks.",
      "When you are ready for your checkride, your instructor will help you schedule it. We have DPEs that we get regular dates for and others that we call and schedule when we have a student just about ready. Most students can get a checkride in less than month from the time we sign you off. Some rides, such as the multi-engine and initial Flight Instructor Practical Test, can take longer to get scheduled due to the limited number of DPEs that are qualified to administer them. Once your test is scheduled, your CFI will continue to work with you on ground and flight lessons to ensure you stay sharp.",
      "As mentioned, your oral exam is going to be based on the testing document from the FAA. The FAA strongly encourages DPEs to administer a scenario-based exam where it makes sense to do so. What this likely means is that your knowledge will be applied to one or more hypothetical situations, and you will be asked to explain how you are going to proceed or what you are going to do, and why.",
      "One recommendation we give students for their checkride is to take the ACS/PTS and use it to create blueprint to your checkride. First, go through each task and sub-item/code and attempt to document where the source of this topic come from. For example, if you are looking at the line item on the Private ACS about BasicMed, the ACS code is PA.I.A.K5 and the regulations are found in part 68 of the FAR. This line item already tells you it is in part 68, so no extra note pointing to the reg is needed. Then on the page, you might make a few key notes to jog your memory about BasicMed that should expect to be able to explainâ€¦the privileges and limitations of BasicMed, how to obtain it and how to retain it. If the DPE wants more than you have in your head or notes, you know exactly where to dig in the FARs to answer his or her question.",

You will be fine looking up a few key details, if needed, but one should be conversational about all these items. The DPE is looking to determine if you know what you are allowed to do, not do, and when you cannot temporarily do something (e.g. when ill). You will likely get a scenario or two given to you and then asked to determine how you will response as PIC. Once you answer, expect to be asked why you gave the answer you gave.",

It\'s a common error to not understand the term "common purpose" and assume that just because you pay your share, the flight is legal.',

Be sure to pre-mark all inspection items and compliance items so you can easily show them to the examiner.",

They know they need to placard it, but often forget about the required aircraft logbook entry and who can make that entry.
