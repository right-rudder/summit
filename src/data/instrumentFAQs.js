      "Want the extra training to more safely fly in a variety of conditions.",

    list: [
      "Complete ground school (online + instructor): Upon completion you will take a FAA knowledge exam on aviation topics such as advanced weather, instrument flight rules and procedures, instrument navigation systems, etc.",
      `Simulated and instrument flight training:  You'll fly under "the hood" or in actual instrument conditions (Piper aircraft only) with an trained CFI instrument instructor to learn how to scan instruments, fly under IFR conditions, navigate with instruments, and depart and approach airports with instrument techniques.`,
      `Cross country flights:  One benefit of an instrument rating is the expanded cross country capabilities and you'll hone your instrument skills on cross country flights.`,
      "Checkride preparation:  Once all the FAA requirements are competed, you'll begin to focus on bringing it all together. You'll work with your instructor to prep for the oral portion of your checkride and fly together to ensure all your flight tasks meet the FAA airmen certification standards for private pilots.",

    title: "Why packages?",
    content:
      "We offer our best pricing with these packages because it allows us to manage our aircraft and instructor workloads more predictably and efficiently.

    title: "What happens if I exceed my allocated flight hours?",
    content:
      "We really strive for this not to happen by providing average flight hours that are needed for the program length you select. However, in the event this happens we will provide you additional aircraft and/or instructor hour at an agreed upon discounted rate.",

  {
    title: "What happens if I need to quit or defer my training?",
    content: `Life happens, we get it.  If you need to defer your training you may pause payments and elect a future restart date.  If you have paid off your program, but have not completed it, your program remains valid for one year after the initial program end date. Upon restart, you may receive a new instructor and experience the need to fly additional hours to complete your certificate, but we will provide all hours originally paid for by your package.
If you need to withdrawal from your program, you will lose access to the preferred package pricing. We will bill you current retail pricing, plus a 5% administrative fee for all instructor services and flight time flown. Insurance, ground school, and Foreflight fees are, unfortunately, non-refundable. Any remaining money on account will be refunded within 7 days of written notice of withdrawal.  If your account is in deficit, we will need the balance paid off at time of cancellation.`,
