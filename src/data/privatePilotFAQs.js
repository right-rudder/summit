      "Cross country flight training: You'll leave the local airport area and start learning how to navigate and fly to new places!",

    title: "Why Packages?",
    content:
      "We offer our best pricing with these packages because it allows us to manage our aircraft and instructor workloads more predictably and efficiently.

    title: "What happens if I don't use all my flight hours?",

      "This generally does not occur as we have built our packages with the averages in mind. However, in the event it does we will gladly move those hours into another package or you may use them for rental purposes within 90 days of your checkride.",

    title: "What happens if I exceed my allocated flight hours?",

  {
    title: "What happens if I need to quit or defer my training?",
    content:
      "Life happens, we get it. If you need to defer your training you may pause payments and elect a future restart date. If you have paid off your program, but have not completed it, your program remains valid for six months after the initial program end date. Upon restart, you may receive a new instructor and experience the need to fly additional hours to complete your certificate, but we will provide all hours originally paid for by your package. After six months, the cash value of your program remains for another six months. However, we may need to reprice your package if costs have increased. If you need to completely withdraw from your program, there is no obligation beyond a 10% administrative fee of the unearned remaining program value. This serves to reimburse Summit Flight for the package discounts afforded in your training package. For example, if you are one month into the expedited program and need to cancel, the fee to cancel is $900 on an outstanding $9000 balance. Insurance, ground school, pilot supplies, and Foreflight fees are, unfortunately, non-refundable. Any remaining money on the account will be refunded within 7 days of written notice of withdrawal. If your account is in deficit, we will need the balance paid off at the time of cancellation.",
