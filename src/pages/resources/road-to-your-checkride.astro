  <UnderHeader
    title="What is the Checkride?"
    text1="The checkride is the final step in obtaining a new certificate or rating, often referred to formally as the FAA 'Practical Test.' Administered by a Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE), this exam evaluates your ability to safely and competently operate an aircraft according to FAA standards. It’s more than just a flight; it’s the culmination of your training, knowledge, and decision-making skills."
    text2="During the checkride, the examiner will assess your performance in both oral and flight portions. The oral exam focuses on your ability to apply aeronautical knowledge to real-world scenarios, such as weather interpretation, flight planning, and safety decision-making. The flight portion tests your ability to meet FAA standards consistently, handle maneuvers, and make sound go/no-go judgments in actual flight conditions."
    text3="Read below to learn more about what to expect, how to prepare, and how to succeed during your checkride with a DPE."

    title="Ready for Your Checkride?"
    text1="Your checkride represents the culmination of all your hard work, training, and dedication. With preparation, focus, and the guidance of your instructor, you’re ready to demonstrate your knowledge, skills, and decision-making ability to a Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE)."
    text2="Remember, the DPE isn’t looking for perfection—they’re assessing your ability to safely and consistently meet FAA standards. By studying the ACS/PTS, practicing thoroughly, and understanding how to apply your knowledge, you set yourself up for success."
    text3="Take a deep breath, trust your training, and approach the checkride with confidence. Passing this final step opens the door to new opportunities in aviation and marks the beginning of the next stage of your flying journey."
