              When renting an aircraft, it's a lot like renting a car. Without
              insurance, the renter is liable for anything and everything.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">
              Similar to car rental agencies, we maintain commercial insurance
              on our aircraft so they can be used for flight training and rental
              purposes. However, our policies are intended to protect our
              aircraft and business.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">
              In the event of a pilot-caused incident, insurance companies will
              often subrogate (initiate a reimbursement demand) to the
              responsible party.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">
              We have partnered with the Marsh McLennon Agency and their
              insurance provider, Global Aerospace Insurance, to easily provide
              non-owned aviation insurance to our students and renters.
