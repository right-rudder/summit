            We call this the "Cross Country Pilot Package". Pilots looking to
            fly longer distances will benefit from the flexibility that earning
            an instrument rating on top of a private pilot certificate offers.
            To facilitate this, we offer a combined private and instrument
            package that with the option to complete your training in 7 or 10
            months.

            your training program. We offer you two speeds at which to complete
