            We call this the "Cross Country Pilot Package". Pilots looking to
            fly longer distances will benefit from the flexibility that earning
            an instrument rating on top of a private pilot certificate offers.
            To facilitate this, we offer a combined private and instrument
            package that with the option to complete your training in 7 or 10
            months.

            For this program we offer you special savings for continuing on with

            completed. Like career track programs, staying in the training
            environment offers you the opportunity to be most efficient with
            your training program. We offer you two speeds at which to complete
            this program.â€‹
