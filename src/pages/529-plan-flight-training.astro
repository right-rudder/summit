        Why This Change Matters
      </h3>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Before this legislation, 529 plans were limited mostly to college
        tuition. Now, the government officially recognizes the value of aviation
        training as a
        <strong>professional education path</strong>. This makes pilot training
        more affordable and accessible for families who’ve been saving for
        education.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-3">
        At Summit Flight Academy, we’re thrilled to see the aviation community
        receive this support — because it means more aspiring pilots can take
        their first step into the skies without financial barriers holding them
        back.
