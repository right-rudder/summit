  <!-- Why -->
  <div class="bg-gray-900 p-8 text-white">

      <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-main-red mb-4">
        Why This Change Matters
      </h3>
      <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
        Before this legislation, 529 plans were limited mostly to college
        tuition. Now, the government officially recognizes the value of aviation
        training as a
        <strong>professional education path</strong>. This makes pilot training
        more affordable and accessible for families who’ve been saving for
        education.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mt-3">
        At Summit Flight Academy, we’re thrilled to see the aviation community
        receive this support, because it means more aspiring pilots can take
        their first step into the skies without financial barriers holding them
        back.
