With everything going on in the world right now (Coronavirus, I’m looking at you), getting a pilot certificate is likely the last thing on your mind. It makes sense- An unexpected deadly pandemic does tend to be overwhelming.

The thing is, without your usual life to keep you busy, there’s probably some extra time on your hands. Plus, what better way to brighten a world full of bleak news than to try something new and exciting?

If you’ve had your eye on aviation school before, this might just be the perfect time to get into it. Here are three tips for pilot training in the age of COVID (and in general).

1. Be Tenacious

So you’ve been thinking about aviation school, and you’re wondering what you need to qualify for a pilot certificate. There’s something you should know… It’s not easy. But hey, who doesn’t love a challenge?

Pilot training takes just as much effort as you’d expect. You’re going to need to prepare yourself for multiple exams. They’ll vary in subjects like aviation medicine, aerodynamics, radio communication procedure, flight regulations, and more. You’re also going to need up to 40 hours of flight time.

This is why it’s extremely important to hold on tight to your goals. The road will be demanding, but your ambition will guide you to success!

2. Be Adaptable

This is especially important in our world’s current social climate. Class schedules are unpredictable at the moment, and aviation school is no exception. You might find yourself taking exams in person one day, and online the next.

Think about it as one big metaphor for flying. The truth is, flying is unpredictable too. (Still worth it, though.) You never know what you’re going to have to deal with once you’re up in the air, so it’s good to have quick thinking skills and lend yourself to adaptability in any situation.

3. Be Patient

Patience might just be the most important thing on this list. You’ve probably gathered by now that pilot training is no joke, and the path to a pilot certificate can be full of unexpected challenges. You need to be kind to yourself and remember that you’re only human.

With that in mind, there’s no denying that the experience will breed an amazing reward. There’s no freedom like the sky, and getting to fly an airplane is a magical experience that opens up a world of opportunity.

So get out there and start learning!
