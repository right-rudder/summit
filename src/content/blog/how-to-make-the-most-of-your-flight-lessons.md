As a flight student, you know that aviation schools do not come cheap. That's why, when you arrive for each flight lesson, it's important to make sure you are prepared to get the most out of each lesson by maximizing your money and time.

Here are a few tips to help you optimize each flight lesson.

## Consistency and Frequency

Most aviation schools and instructors recommend at least 2-3 lessons per week. When a flight student goes too long between classes, they forget certain things, and part of the class has to be spent re-teaching part of the previous lessons. It's best to scrunch your flight lessons close to each other to build muscle memory and retain more information. Consistency is key to practicing and building on the skills being taught. Stay consistent with your lessons by prioritizing them within your schedule.

## Homework

Studying and training at home will help you spend more time in the air, and less time on the ground during your next lesson. There are several materials and sources you can work on at home to keep you ahead of the curve.

- Take notes during your post-flight briefings. Your instructor will give you a post-flight brief in which you both go over what you did good on during your flight and what you need to work on. Document all of those details from the briefing to help you improve and enhance your skills. Research ways to improve what you are lacking and build on the skills you have already mastered, all of this information will optimize your next flight lesson.

- Boost your in-person flight lessons with supplemental learning materials from online courses. These courses are valuable educational resources that can enhance your pilot knowledge and skills. The Aircraft Owners and Pilot Association has an excellent online educational platform for free, so you can study up at home and prepare for your next flight lesson.

- You can always ask your flight instructor for homework if you want more material to work on at home. Your instructor will most likely give you homework on what your next lesson will be about, giving you more time to learn specific maneuvers and concepts.

## Good Habits

Develop good flight habits to avoid having problems mid-flight and taking attention away from your lesson. Ask your instructor to do a pre-flight check with you before every lesson, make sure your cockpit is organized, and arrive well-rested for each flight lesson. Doing all of these things will allow you to focus on learning without hindering the process with unnecessary problems.
