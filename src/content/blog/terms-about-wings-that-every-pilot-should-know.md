Becoming a pilot is more than just having the passion to fly. When you become a pilot, you will need to know many terms about the airplane and all its parts. These pilot terms about the wings are crucial for you to recognize.

## Wing Span

Wing span is the distance from wing tip to wing tip

## Chord Line

The chord line runs from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the wing.

## Midline

The midline is the average line running symmetrically through the center of the wing.

## Camber

The camber is the difference between the midline and the chord line.

## Wing Area

The wing surface area including the area covered by the fuselage.

## Angle Of Attack

It is the most common term used in aviation for the difference between the chord line and the relative wind.

## Angle of Incidence

The angle of incidence is the angle between the longitudinal axis of the aircraft and the chord line of the wing.

## Wing Washout

It is a change in an airfoil's angle of incidence, measured from the root to the tip.

## Aspect Ratio

This is the wing span divided by the average chord. You'll find high aspect ratio wings on gliders and low aspect ratio wings on fighter jets.
