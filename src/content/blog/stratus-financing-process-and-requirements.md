## **5. How Funding Works & Handling of Unused Funds**

Flight schools “agree to return unused funds in order to minimize your debt obligation” (source).

This prevents overborrowing and protects students from unnecessary long-term debt.

## **6. Common Delays and What to Expect**

The raw intelligence does **not** specify typical delay durations. However, delays can occur when:

- Documents are missing  
- Employment verification requires additional confirmation  
- Underwriting requests clarification  

Any area marked “not specified in the source” will be presented transparently to ensure accuracy.

Per Stratus documentation:

- **Deferred payments** available during training (source: stratusFAQs)
- **Interest-only** payments available while building hours to ATP minimums (source)
