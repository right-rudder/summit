Even skilled pilots make errors under pressure. Examiners often report that checkride failures aren’t due to lack of skill, but nerves. At Summit Flight Academy in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, we prepare our Kansas City student pilots to avoid the most common mistakes.

---

## 1. **Top Flight Errors**

- Fluctuating airspeed during maneuvers.
- Forgetting to use rudder in steep turns.
- Poor setup on soft-field takeoffs.
- Inconsistent checklist use.

---

## 2. **Ground Portion Mistakes**

- Weak airspace knowledge.
- Struggling with systems explanations.
- Overcomplicating answers instead of keeping it clear.

---

## 3. **Summit’s Prevention Strategy**

We prepare students by:

- Conducting **mock checkrides** with different instructors.
- Reviewing **DPE debrief trends** from past students.
- Practicing maneuvers under simulated stress.

---

## 4. **Tips for Checkride Day**

- Fly like it’s a normal lesson—don’t overthink.
- Take a deep breath before each maneuver.
- Remember: one mistake rarely fails you—it’s about overall safety and judgment.

## Why It Matters

Checkrides measure safety, not perfection. By avoiding common errors, you’ll prove you’re a safe and competent pilot.
