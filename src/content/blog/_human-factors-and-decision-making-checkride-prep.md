Flying isn’t just about stick and rudder skills, it’s about judgment. The FAA emphasizes human factors on every checkride, and at Summit Flight Academy in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, we make sure Kansas City student pilots are ready to demonstrate safe decision-making.

## 1. **What Examiners Look For**

Examiners often ask scenario-based questions such as:

- “What would you do if weather deteriorated en route?”
- “How do you handle fatigue before a solo flight?”
- “What’s your go/no-go decision process?”

---

## 2. **Risk Management Models**

At Summit, we use FAA-recognized models like:

- **IMSAFE checklist** (Illness, Medication, Stress, Alcohol, Fatigue, Eating).
- **PAVE checklist** (Pilot, Aircraft, enVironment, External pressures).

---

## 3. **Common Student Errors**

- Giving “rote” textbook answers instead of real examples.
- Ignoring external pressures (like passengers waiting at the destination).
- Failing to explain decision-making in clear steps.

---

## 4. **Tips for Checkride Success**

- Always verbalize your risk assessment.
- Share a personal example from training flights.
- Show awareness of limits, knowing when _not_ to fly is professionalism.

## Why It Matters

Good decision-making prevents accidents. Demonstrating this skill proves you’re not just ready to pass the checkride, you’re ready to fly responsibly.
