At Summit Flight Academy, we pride ourselves on offering top-tier flight lessons designed to take you from zero experience to a professional pilot. Our comprehensive pilot training programs are crafted to provide you with the skills and knowledge needed to excel in the aviation industry. Whether you're aiming for a career in the skies or simply pursuing a passion, our zero-to-hero training pathway and specialized multi-engine (ME) training set the standard for excellence in Kansas City and Overland Park.

Choosing a zero-to-hero training program ensures a timely and structured learning experience. From your first flight lesson to earning your commercial pilot’s license, our curriculum is designed to build your skills progressively. This continuity allows for a more cohesive understanding of flight principles and techniques.

## The Perks

Training at the same flight school throughout your journey means you’ll benefit from a consistent learning environment. You'll develop strong relationships with our experienced flight instructors, who understand your strengths and areas for improvement. This personalized approach enhances your learning experience and boosts your confidence.

Our zero-to-hero program covers all aspects of pilot training, including private pilot license (PPL), instrument rating (IR), commercial pilot license (CPL), and multi-engine rating (ME). This comprehensive approach ensures you’re not only proficient in single-engine aircraft but also capable of handling more complex multi-engine planes, broadening your career opportunities.

Opting for a complete training package can be more cost-effective than enrolling in separate courses at different stages. At Summit Flight Academy, we offer competitive pricing and financial planning assistance to make your dream of becoming a pilot more attainable.

## The Importance of Multi-Engine Training

Multi-Engine Training is one of the final parts of our career track cirriculum at Summit Flight Academy. This is a recently released training program offered at Summit Flight Academy, so we figured we should highlight it here!
