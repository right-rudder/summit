What an absolutely magical day it was! On Friday, May 30th, 2025, Summit Flight Academy officially broke ground on our new hangar at Lee's Summit Airport, and we're still buzzing with excitement from the incredible celebration that unfolded. The warmth, enthusiasm, and genuine camaraderie of our aviation community made this day truly unforgettable, and our hearts are full as we reflect on this momentous milestone.

## A Dream Years in the Making

After several years of careful planning, dreaming, and anticipating, we finally had the privilege of turning the first shovel of dirt at KLXT North Ramp. But this groundbreaking represents so much more than the beginning of construction—it's the culmination of countless conversations, shared aspirations, and the unwavering support of an extraordinary community that has believed in our vision from day one.

As we stood there at 5:30 PM, surrounded by the faces of people who have become like family to us, the ceremony felt like the natural progression of a journey we've all been on together. Every student who has trusted us with their aviation dreams, every instructor who has shared their passion and expertise, every business partner who has stood by us, and every staff member who pours their heart into this academy—you were all there in spirit, and many of you were there in person, making the moment even more special.

## An Afternoon of Pure Joy

From the moment the first guests arrived at 4:30 PM until the last farewells were exchanged after 6:00 PM, our celebration at 2750 NE Douglas St was filled with the kind of warmth and excitement that makes you remember why you fell in love with aviation in the first place. The energy was infectious, the laughter was genuine, and the sense of shared purpose was palpable.

### The Soundtrack of Success

The live music that filled the air throughout the afternoon created the perfect backdrop for our celebration. As melodies drifted across the ramp, mixing with the sounds of animated conversations and bursts of laughter, we couldn't help but feel that we were experiencing something truly special. The musicians captured the spirit of the day beautifully, and their performances added a layer of joy that made the entire event feel like a festival of aviation dreams coming to life.

### Sweet Moments with Sylas and Maddy's

The partnership with Sylas and Maddy's for free ice cream was nothing short of brilliant! Watching children's eyes light up as they chose their favorite flavors, seeing seasoned pilots enjoying a nostalgic treat, and witnessing new friendships form over shared scoops of ice cream reminded us that the best celebrations bring out the child-like wonder in all of us. The ice cream wasn't just delicious—it was a symbol of the sweetness that comes from achieving long-held dreams and sharing them with people who matter.

There's something magical about ice cream that breaks down barriers and brings people together. We watched as conversations flowed naturally between students and instructors, as business partners chatted with families, and as strangers became friends over their shared love of aviation and their mutual appreciation for a perfectly crafted sundae. These moments of connection were exactly what we had hoped for, and they exceeded our wildest expectations.

### Raffle Excitement and Generous Hearts

Our raffle, featuring over $1,000 in prizes, brought out the playful competitive spirit in everyone! The excitement was contagious as numbers were called and winners celebrated. But what touched us most wasn't just the joy of the winners—it was the genuine happiness that everyone shared in each other's good fortune. The applause, the congratulations, and the good-natured excitement reminded us that our community is filled with people who genuinely celebrate each other's successes.

The generosity of our sponsors and partners who contributed to the raffle prizes was overwhelming. Their support didn't just provide great prizes—it demonstrated the incredible network of businesses and individuals who believe in Summit Flight Academy's mission and want to see us succeed.

### The Heart of It All: Our Amazing Community

Perhaps the most beautiful aspect of the entire celebration was witnessing the incredible tapestry of our aviation community come together. Current students shared their training experiences with prospective pilots, seasoned aviators offered encouragement and wisdom to those just beginning their journey, and instructors connected with families to answer questions and share their passion for teaching.

We watched as children gazed up at aircraft with wonder, their imaginations already taking flight. We saw the pride in parents' eyes as they watched their adult children pursue their aviation dreams. We witnessed the quiet satisfaction of experienced pilots who remembered their own first solo flights and first cross-country adventures. These connections, these shared stories, these moments of mutual inspiration—this is what makes Summit Flight Academy more than just a flight school. We're a family, and Friday's celebration proved it beyond any doubt.

## Touching Down and Taking Off

The sight of aircraft arriving at KLXT North Ramp throughout the afternoon was absolutely thrilling! Each landing brought new faces, new stories, and new energy to our celebration. Watching pilots taxi in, shut down their engines, and walk over to join the festivities with smiles on their faces reminded us of the freedom and joy that aviation brings to our lives.

For those who drove to join us, the parking lot became its own gathering place where conversations continued long after the official ceremony ended. The mix of aircraft and automobiles perfectly symbolized how aviation brings together people from all walks of life, united by a shared passion for flight and a commitment to pursuing dreams that literally lift us off the ground.

## A Ceremony to Remember

When 5:30 PM arrived and it was time for the official groundbreaking ceremony, the atmosphere was electric. As we gathered around the ceremonial shovels, looking out at the faces of people who have supported us through every step of our journey, the moment felt both surreal and perfectly natural.

The ceremony wasn't just about breaking ground—it was about breaking through to a new level of possibility. As we turned that first shovel of dirt, we weren't just starting construction on a building; we were laying the foundation for countless future success stories, for dreams that haven't even been dreamed yet, and for adventures that will take our students and pilots to destinations they've only imagined.

## The Ripple Effect of Gratitude

In the days since our celebration, we've been overwhelmed by the messages, photos, and expressions of excitement from everyone who attended. The stories people have shared about the connections they made, the inspiration they felt, and the renewed enthusiasm for their own aviation journeys have reminded us why we do what we do.

To our students—both current and future—thank you for trusting us with your dreams and for bringing such enthusiasm and dedication to everything you do. Your progress, your achievements, and your passion inspire us every single day. Watching you grow as pilots and as individuals is the greatest reward we could ask for.

To our incredible instructors and staff, your dedication goes far beyond just teaching procedures and techniques. You're mentors, cheerleaders, and guardians of aviation's greatest traditions. The care you show for each student, the extra time you spend answering questions, and the genuine investment you make in every person's success is what sets Summit Flight Academy apart.

To our business partners and sponsors, your support enables us to dream bigger and reach further than we ever could alone. Your belief in our mission and your willingness to invest in the future of aviation in our community means more than we can adequately express.

## Building More Than Just a Hangar

As construction begins on our new hangar, we're reminded daily that we're building more than just a structure. We're creating a space where dreams will take physical form, where nervous students will gain confidence, where experienced pilots will share their knowledge, and where the next generation of aviators will prepare for adventures we can only imagine.

This hangar will house aircraft, certainly, but more importantly, it will house hope, ambition, dedication, and the unwavering belief that the sky is not the limit—it's just the beginning. Every rivet, every beam, every square foot of space will be infused with the support and encouragement of the community that made this expansion possible.

We're planning to document the construction process and share regular updates because this hangar belongs to all of us. It's a physical manifestation of our shared commitment to excellence in aviation training and our collective belief in the power of flight to transform lives.

## Looking Forward with Excitement

As we move forward with construction, we're already envisioning the ribbon-cutting ceremony that will mark the completion of our new facility. We're imagining the first aircraft to be housed in the new hangar, the first maintenance session to be completed in the expanded space, and the first group of students to benefit from the enhanced training environment.

But more than anything, we're looking forward to continuing this incredible journey with all of you. The groundbreaking celebration was a beautiful beginning, but it's just that—a beginning. The real magic will happen in the months and years to come as we continue to grow together, to support each other's dreams, and to push the boundaries of what's possible in aviation training.

## A Heartfelt Thank You

As we close this reflection on our unforgettable groundbreaking celebration, we want to express our deepest gratitude to every single person who has been part of this journey. Whether you were there in person on May 30th, whether you've been supporting us from afar, or whether you're just now discovering what Summit Flight Academy is all about, you are part of our story.

The success of our groundbreaking celebration wasn't measured in the number of attendees or the amount of ice cream consumed (though both were impressive!). It was measured in the smiles, the connections, the renewed excitement for aviation, and the sense of shared purpose that filled the air throughout the afternoon.

Thank you for believing in us, for supporting us, for challenging us to be better, and for reminding us every day why we fell in love with aviation in the first place. The journey ahead is bright, the sky is wide open, and with this incredible community by our side, we're ready for whatever adventures await.

Here's to the next chapter, to the dreams yet to be fulfilled, and to the countless takeoffs and landings that will happen in our new hangar. Most of all, here's to the amazing people who make Summit Flight Academy not just a flight school, but a family.

Blue skies and tailwinds to all!
