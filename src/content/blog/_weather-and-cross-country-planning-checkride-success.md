Every FAA checkride includes a weather and cross-country planning component. At Summit Flight Academy in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, we train Kansas City student pilots to not only interpret data, but to apply it in real flight decisions.

---

## 1. **Weather Interpretation**

Examiners expect you to confidently analyze:

- METARs and TAFs.
- Weather charts such as prog charts, winds aloft, and radar summaries.
- Convective outlooks and icing forecasts.

**Common Mistake:** Memorizing weather codes but failing to explain what they mean for an actual flight.

---

## 2. **Cross-Country Planning**

The examiner may ask you to prepare a full flight plan, including:

- Fuel requirements with reserves.
- Alternate airport options.
- Groundspeed, headings, and checkpoints.

At Summit, we emphasize practical Kansas City area routes, such as Lee’s Summit (KLXT) to Columbia (KCOU).

---

## 3. **Scenario-Based Questions**

Examiners often add “what if” scenarios:

- “What would you do if ceilings dropped mid-flight?”
- “How would strong headwinds change your plan?”

---

## 4. **Pro Tips for Success**

- Always double-check NOTAMs.
- Use E6B and ForeFlight together to verify numbers.
- Explain _why_ you made each decision, not just the numbers.

---

## Why It Matters

Weather and cross-country skills ensure you’re not just legal, but safe and capable in real-world flying.
