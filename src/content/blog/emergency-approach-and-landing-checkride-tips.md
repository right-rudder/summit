Emergency procedures aren’t just a test item, they’re a lifesaving skill. At Summit Flight Academy in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, we train our Kansas City student pilots to stay calm and precise when handling simulated emergencies on checkride day.

## 1. **The Examiner’s Focus**

The FAA Airman Certification Standards (ACS) requires you to demonstrate:

- Establishing **best glide speed** within ±10 knots.
- Selecting a **suitable landing area** considering wind, terrain, and obstructions.
- Using checklists and cockpit resources effectively.

---

## 2. **Common Student Mistakes**

From our experience and DPE feedback, the most common errors include:

- Forgetting to trim for best glide.
- Letting airspeed fluctuate due to distraction.
- Setting up for a tailwind landing.

---

## 3. **Summit’s Proven Training Approach**

Our instructors emphasize:

- **Wind awareness:** Always use cockpit tools or preflight wind briefings.
- **Trim discipline:** Trim early so you can focus on the landing site.
- **Decision-making:** Prioritize a safe field, not just the closest one.

---

## 4. **Tips for Checkride Success**

- Practice simulated emergencies on every solo.
- Talk through your thought process out loud, examiners value clear decision-making.
- Keep flying the airplane until the maneuver is complete.

## Why It Matters

Emergencies don’t follow a script. Building muscle memory through repetition ensures you’ll react calmly, whether during a checkride or a real in-flight event.
