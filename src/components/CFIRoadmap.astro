              <p class="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-800">
                The journey to becoming a Certified Flight Instructor begins
                with meeting the prerequisites set forth by the Federal Aviation
                Administration (FAA). To embark on this rewarding path, you must
                first obtain a Commercial Pilot Certificate and accumulate the
                required flight hours, typically 250 hours or more.
                Additionally, you'll need to possess a valid medical
                certificate, demonstrating your physical and mental fitness for
                flight operations.
